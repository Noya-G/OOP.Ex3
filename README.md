# About
This python project represents a **directed weighted graph** with various methods and **Dijkstra's 
shortest path** algorithm.  

  
## The Project
Contains various graph theory methods that can be done on a directed weighted graph
implemented by two different interfaces and visualized as well


#### Directed weighted graph class methods:
- _Add\remove a vertex on the graph._ 
- _Add an edge by connecting two vertices._ 
- _Check whether vertices has an edge between them or not._ 
- Check out the wiki for more!

#### Graph Algorithms methods:
- _Check for connection components._
- _Check for connection components of a specific vertex._ 
- _Find **the shortest path** between two vertices by using Dijkstra Algorithm._
- _And much more..._
   (for further explanation please check the wiki)
